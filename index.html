    <h1><em>The Stranger (Camus novel)</em></h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p1>
            <strong><em>The Stranger</em></strong> (French: <strong><em>L'Étranger</em></strong> [l‿e.tʁɑ̃.ʒe]), also
            published in English as <strong><em>The Outsider</em></strong>,
            is a 1942 novella by French author Albert Camus. Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus'
            philosophy, absurdism, coupled with existentialism;
            though Camus personally rejected the latter label.<sup>[1]</sup>
            <br><br>
            The title character is Meursault, an indifferent French settler in Algeria described as "a citizen of France
            domiciled in North Africa, a man of the Mediterranean, an homme du midi yet one who hardly partakes of the
            traditional Mediterranean culture."<sup>[2]</sup>
            Weeks after his mother's funeral, he kills an Arab man in French Algiers, who was involved in a conflict
            with one of Meursault's neighbors. Meursault is tried and sentenced to death.
            The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's first-person narrative view before and after the
            murder, respectively.
            <br><br>
            In January 1955, Camus wrote this:
            <br><br>
            I summarized <em>The Stranger</em> a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: "In our
            society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death." I only
            meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game.<sup>[3]</sup>
            <br><br>
            The Stranger's first edition consisted of only 4,400 copies, which was so few that it could not be a
            best-seller.
            Since the novella was published during the Nazi occupation of France, there was a possibility that the
            Propaganda-Staffel would censor it, but a representative of the Occupation authorities felt it contained
            nothing damaging to their cause, so it was published without omissions.
            However, the novel was well received in anti-Nazi circles in addition to Jean-Paul Sartre's article
            <em>"Explication de L'Étranger"</em>.<sup>[4]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Translated four times into English, and also into numerous other languages, the novel has long been
            considered a classic of 20th-century literature. Le Monde ranks it as number one on its 100 Books of the
            Century.
            <br><br>
            The novel was twice adapted as films: <em>Lo Straniero</em> (1967) (Italian) by Luchino Visconti and
            <em>Yazgı</em> (2001, <em>Fate</em>) by Zeki Demirkubuz (Turkish).

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p1>
            Meursault learns of the death of his mother, who has been living in an old age home in the country. He takes
            time off from work to attend her funeral, but he shows none of the indications of grief or mourning that the
            people around him expect from someone in his situation. When asked if he wishes to view her body, he
            declines, and he smokes and drinks regular (white) coffee - not the obligatory black coffee - at the vigil
            held by his mother's coffin the night before the burial. Most of his comments to the reader at this time are
            about his observations of the aged attendees at the vigil and funeral, which takes place on an unbearably
            hot day.
            <br><br>
            Back in Algiers, Meursault encounters Marie, a former secretary of his firm. The two become re-acquainted,
            swim together, watch a comedy film, and begin to have an intimate relationship. All of this happens on the
            day after his mother's funeral.
            <br><br>
            Over the next few days, Meursault helps Raymond Sintès, a neighbor and friend who is rumored to be a pimp,
            but says he works in a warehouse, to get revenge on a Moorish girlfriend he suspects has been accepting
            gifts and money from another man. Raymond asks Meursault to write a letter inviting the girl over to
            Raymond's apartment solely so that he can have sex with her and then spit in her face and throw her out.
            While he listens to Raymond, Meursault is characteristically unfazed by any feelings of empathy, so he does
            not express concern that Raymond's girlfriend would be emotionally hurt by this plan and agrees to write the
            letter. In general, Meursault considers other people either interesting or annoying, or feels nothing for
            them at all.
            <br><br>
            Raymond's girlfriend visits him on a Sunday morning, and the police get involved when he beats her for
            slapping him after he tries to kick her out. He asks Meursault to testify that the girlfriend had been
            unfaithful when he is called to the police station, to which Meursault agrees. Ultimately, Raymond is let
            off with a warning.
            <br><br>
            While this is going on, Meursault's boss asks him if he would like to work at a branch their firm is
            thinking about opening in Paris and Marie asks him if he wants to get married. In both cases, Meursault says
            that he does not have strong feelings about the matter, but he is willing to move or get married if it will
            please the other party. Also, Salamano, Meursault and Raymond's curmudgeonly old neighbor, loses his abused
            and diseased dog and, though he mostly outwardly maintains his usual spiteful and uncaring attitude toward
            the creature, he goes to Meursault for comfort and advice a few times. During one of these conversations,
            Salamano, who says he adopted the dog as a companion shortly after his wife's death, mentions that some
            neighbors had 'said nasty things' about Meursault after he sent his mother to a retirement home. Meursault
            is surprised to learn about this negative impression of his actions.
            <br><br>
            One weekend, Raymond invites Meursault and Marie to a friend's beach cabin. There they see the brother of
            Raymond's spurned girlfriend along with another Arab, who Raymond has mentioned have been following him
            around recently. The Arabs confront Raymond and his friend, and the brother wounds Raymond with a knife
            before running away. Later, Meursault walks back along the beach alone, armed with a revolver he took from
            Raymond to prevent him from acting rashly, and encounters the brother of Raymond's girlfriend. Disoriented
            and on the edge of heatstroke, Meursault shoots when the Arab flashes his knife at him. It is a fatal shot,
            but Meursault shoots the man four more times after a pause. He does not divulge to the reader any specific
            reason for this act or what he feels, other than being bothered by the heat and intensely bright sunlight.
            <br><br>
        </p1>
        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p1>
            Meursault is now incarcerated. His general detachment and ability to adapt to any external circumstance seem
            to make living in prison tolerable, especially after he gets used to the idea of being restricted and unable
            to have sex with Marie, though he does realize at one point that he has been unknowingly talking to himself
            for a number of days. For almost a year, he sleeps, looks out the small window of his cell, and mentally
            lists the objects in his old apartment while he waits for his day in court.
            <br><br>
            Meursault never denies that he killed the Arab, so, at his trial, the prosecuting attorney focuses more on
            Meursault's inability or unwillingness to cry at his mother's funeral than on the details of the murder. He
            portrays Meursault's quietness and passivity as demonstrating his criminality and lack of remorse and
            denounces Meursault as a soul-less monster who deserves to die for his crime. To the reader, Meursault
            acknowledges that he has never felt regret for any of his actions because, he says, he has always been too
            absorbed in the present moment. Although several of Meursault's friends testify on his behalf and his
            attorney tells him the sentence will likely be light, Meursault is sentenced to be publicly decapitated.
            <br><br>
            Put in a new cell, Meursault obsesses over his impending doom and appeal and tries to imagine some way in
            which he can escape his fate. He repeatedly refuses to see the prison chaplain, but one day the chaplain
            visits him anyway. Meursault says he does not believe in God and is not even interested in the subject, but
            the chaplain persists in trying to lead Meursault away from atheism (or, perhaps more precisely, apatheism).
            The chaplain believes Meursault's appeal will succeed in getting him released from prison, but says such an
            outcome will not get rid of his feelings of guilt or fix his relationship with God. Eventually, Meursault
            accosts the chaplain in a rage. He attacks the chaplain's worldview and patronizing attitude and asserts
            that, in confronting the certainty of the nearness of his death, he has had insights about life and death
            that he feels with a confidence beyond what the chaplain possesses. He says that, although what we say or do
            or feel can cause our deaths to happen at different times or under different circumstances, none of those
            things can change the fact that we are all condemned to die one day, so nothing ultimately matters.
            <br><br>
            After the chaplain leaves, Meursault finds some comfort in thinking about the parallels between his
            situation and how he thinks his mother must have felt when she was surrounded by death and slowly dying at
            the retirement home. Yelling at the chaplain had emptied him of all hope or thoughts of escape or a
            successful appeal, so he is able to open his heart 'to the benign indifference of the universe,' after which
            he decides that he has been, and still is, happy. His final assertion is that a large, hateful crowd at his
            execution will end his loneliness and bring everything to a consummate end.

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Meursault</strong> (<sub>pronounced</sub> [møʁ.so]) is a French settler in Algeria who learns of
                his
                mother's death by telegram. Meursault's indifference to his mother's death demonstrates some emotional
                detachment from his environment. Other instances are shown. Meursault is also a truthful person,
                speaking his mind without regard for others. He is estranged from society due to his indifference.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Meursault's mother</strong> was sent to an old people's home three years prior to her death, as
                noted in the opening lines of the novel. As Meursault nears the time for his execution, he feels a
                kinship with his mother, thinking she, too, embraced a meaningless universe.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Thomas Pérez</strong> was the fiancé of Meursault's mother while she was in the home. He brings
                up the rear in the funeral procession for Meursault's mother, and Meursault describes in a great amount
                of detail the old man's struggle to keep up. He is called to testify at Meursault's trial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Céleste</strong> is the owner of a café that Meursault frequents. He testifies at Meursault's
                trial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Marie Cardona</strong> was a typist in the same workplace as Meursault. A day after he attends
                his mother's funeral, she meets him at a public pool, and they begin a relationship. Marie, like
                Meursault, enjoys sex. She asks Meursault on one occasion if he loves her, and on another if he would
                like to marry her. To the first he responds with no, the second he seems indifferent to the idea. Marie
                visits him once in prison, but is not permitted any further visits since she is not his wife. She
                testifies at Meursault's trial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Salamano</strong> is an old man who routinely walks his dog. He abuses it but is still attached
                to it. When he loses his dog, he is distressed and asks Meursault for advice. He testifies at
                Meursault's trial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Raymond Sintès</strong> is a neighbour of Meursault who beats his Arab mistress. Her brother and
                friends try to take revenge. He brings Meursault into the conflict, and the latter kills the brother.
                Raymond and Meursault seem to develop a bond, and he testifies for Meursault during his trial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Masson</strong> is the owner of the beach house where Raymond takes Marie and Meursault. Masson
                is a carefree person who likes to live his life and be happy. He testifies at Meursault's trial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Arabs</strong> include Raymond's mistress, her brother, and his assumed friends. None of the
                Arabs in The Stranger are named, reflecting the distance between the French colonists and native people.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Arab</strong> (the brother of the mistress of Raymond) is a man shot and killed by Meursault
                on a beach in Algiers.

        <h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p1>
            In his 1956 analysis of the novel, Carl Viggiani wrote:
            <br><br>
            On the surface, <em>L'Étranger</em> gives the appearance of being an extremely simple though carefully
            planned and
            written book. In reality, it is a dense and rich creation, full of undiscovered meanings and formal
            qualities. It would take a book at least the length of the novel to make a complete analysis of meaning and
            form and the correspondences of meaning and form, in <em>L'Étranger</em>.<sup>[5]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Victor Brombert has analysed <em>L'Étranger</em> and Sartre's "Explication de <em>L'Étranger</em>" in the
            philosophical
            context of the Absurd.<sup>[6]</sup> Louis Hudon dismissed the characterisation of <em>L'Étranger</em> as an
            existentialist
            novel in his 1960 analysis.<sup>[7]</sup> The 1963 study by Ignace Feuerlicht begins with an examination of
            the themes
            of alienation, in the sense of Meursault being a 'stranger' in his society.<sup>[8]</sup> In his 1970
            analysis, Leo
            Bersani commented that <em>L'Étranger</em> is "mediocre" in its attempt to be a "'profound' novel", but
            describes the
            novel as an "impressive if flawed exercise in a kind of writing promoted by the New Novelists of the
            1950s".<sup>[9]</sup> Paul P. Somers Jr. has compared Camus's <em>L'Étranger</em> and Sartre's
            <em>Nausea</em>, in
            light of Sartre's
            essay on Camus's novel.<sup>[10]</sup> Sergei Hackel has explored parallels between <em>L'Étranger</em> and
            Dostoyevsky's <em>Crime and Punishment</em>.<sup>[11]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Terry Otten has studied in detail the relationship between Meursault and his mother.<sup>[12]</sup> Gerald
            Morreale
            examines Meursault's killing of the Arab and the question of whether Meursault's action is an act of
            murder.<sup>[13]</sup> Ernest Simon has examined the nature of Meursault's trial in <em>L'Étranger</em>,
            with respect
            to earlier
            analysis by Richard Weisberg and jurist Richard A. Posner.<sup>[14]</sup> René Girard has critiqued the
            relative nature
            of 'indifference' in the character of Meursault in relation to his surrounding society.<sup>[15]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Kamel Daoud has written a novel <em>The Meursault Investigation</em> (2013/2014), first published in Algeria
            in 2013,
            and then republished in France to critical acclaim. This post-colonialist response to <em>The Stranger</em>
            counters
            Camus's version with elements from the perspective of the unnamed Arab victim's brother (naming him and
            presenting him as a real person who was mourned) and other protagonists. Daoud explores their subsequent
            lives following the withdrawal of French authorities and most pied-noirs from Algeria after the conclusion
            of the Algerian War of Independence in 1962.

        <hr>
        <p1>
            On 27 May 1941, Camus was informed about the changes suggested by André Malraux after he had read the
            manuscript and took his remarks into account.<sup>[16]</sup> For instance, Malraux thought the minimalist
            syntactic
            structure was too repetitive. Some scenes and passages (the murder, the conversation with the chaplain)
            should also be revised. The manuscript was then read by editors Jean Paulhan and Raymond Queneau. Gerhard
            Heller, a German editor, translator and lieutenant in the Wehrmacht working for the Censorship Bureau
            offered to help. The book was eventually published in June 1942–4,400 copies of it were printed.

            Éditions Gallimard first published the original French-language novel in 1942. A British author, Stuart
            Gilbert, first translated <em>L' Étranger</em> into English in 1946; for more than 30 years his version was
            the
            standard English translation. Gilbert's choice of title, <em>The Stranger</em>, was changed by Hamish
            Hamilton to <em>The
                Outsider</em>, because they considered it "more striking and appropriate" and because Maria
            Kuncewiczowa's
            Polish-language novel <em>Cudzoziemka</em> had recently been published in London as <em>The
                Stranger</em>.<sup>[17]</sup> In the United
            States, Knopf had already typeset the manuscript using Gilbert's original title when informed of the name
            change and so disregarded it; the British–American difference in titles has persisted in subsequent
            editions.<sup>[17]</sup>
            <br><br>
            In 1982, the British publisher Hamish Hamilton, which had issued Gilbert's translation, published a
            translation by Joseph Laredo, also as <em>The Outsider</em>. Penguin Books bought this version in 1983 for a
            paperback edition.
            <br><br>
            In 1988, Vintage published a version in the United States with a translation by American Matthew Ward under
            the standard American title of <em>The Stranger</em>. Camus was influenced by American literary style, and
            Ward's
            translation expresses American usage.<sup>[18]</sup>
            <br><br>
            A new translation of <em>The Outsider</em> by Sandra Smith was published by Penguin in 2012.<sup>[19]</sup>
            <br><br>
            A critical difference among these translations is the expression of emotion in the sentence towards the
            close of the novel: "I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe" in Gilbert's
            translation, versus Laredo's "I laid my heart open to the gentle indifference of the universe" (original
            French: <em>la tendre indifférence du monde</em>; literally, "the tender indifference of the world"). The
            Penguin
            Classics 2000 reprint of Laredo's translation has "gentle" changed to "benign".
            <br><br>
            The ending lines differ as well: Gilbert translates "on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd
            of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration", which contrasts with Laredo's
            translation of "greet me with cries of hatred." This passage describes a scene that would serve as a foil to
            the prior "indifference of the world". In French, the phrase is <em>"cris de haine"</em>. Ward translates
            this as
            "with cries of hate". Gilbert juxtaposes "execration" with "execution".
            <br><br>
            <em>"Aujourd'hui, Maman est morte"</em> is the opening sentence of the novel. English translations have
            rendered the
            first sentence as 'Mother died today', 'Maman died today', or a variant thereof. In 2012 Ryan Bloom argued
            that it should be translated as 'Today, Maman died.' He believes this better expresses the character of
            Meursault, as developed in the novel, as someone who 'lives for the moment', 'does not consciously dwell on
            the past', and 'does not worry about the future'.<sup>[20]</sup>

                <em>The Meursault Investigation</em> (2015) by Kamel Daoud is a novel created counter to Camus's
                version, from
                the perspective of an Arab man described as the brother of the murdered man. Referred to only as "The
                Arab" by Camus, in this novel he is said to have been named Musa, and was an actual man who existed and
                was mourned by his brother and mother. It was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book of 2015.
            </li>
            <li>In Camus’ "The Plague", published in 1948, Camus mentions a woman who "started airing her views about a
                murder case that had created some stir in Algiers. A young commercial employee had killed an Algerian on
                a beach".

                "Killing an Arab", the 1979 debut single by the Cure, was described by Robert Smith as "a short poetic
                attempt at condensing my impression of the key moments in 'l'entranger' [<em>sic</em>] (The Outsider) by
                Albert
                Camus".<sup>[21]</sup>

                "Noch koroche dnya", from the 1995 album of the same name by the Russian heavy metal band Aria, is based
                on Meursault's encounter with the chaplain in the final scene of the novel.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
                It is
                narrated from Meursault's first-person perspective and includes (in Russian) the line, "The cries of
                hate will be my reward / Upon my death, I will not be alone".

            <li>
                At the end of "Asa Phelps Is Dead", from the album <em>Ghost Stories</em> by The Lawrence Arms, the
                passage in
                which Meursault accepts his impending execution is read by Chris McCaughan. It parallels certain themes
                in the song's lyrics.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            </li>
            <li>
                Folk singer-songwriter Eric Andersen has a song called "The Stranger (Song of Revenge)", one of four
                songs based on Camus's works on his 2014 EP <em>The Shadow and Light of Albert Camus</em>.

            <li>
                Tuxedomoon's third single was titled "The Stranger" and was reworked in 1981 as "L'étranger (Gigue
                existentielle)" for the <em>Suite en sous-sol</em> EP. The lyrics to both versions include direct
                references to
                the protagonist's mother's death and the expectation that he cry at her funeral.<sup>[22]</sup>
