    <h1><em>The Stranger (Camus novel)</em></h1>

        <strong><em>The Stranger</em></strong> (French: <strong><em>L'Étranger</em></strong> [l‿e.tʁɑ̃.ʒe]), also published in English as <strong><em>The Outsider</em></strong>, 
        is a 1942 novella by French author Albert Camus. Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus' philosophy, absurdism, coupled with existentialism; 
        though Camus personally rejected the latter label.[1]
        The title character is Meursault, an indifferent French settler in Algeria described as "a citizen of France domiciled in North Africa, a man of the Mediterranean, an homme du midi yet one who hardly partakes of the traditional Mediterranean culture."[2] 
        Weeks after his mother's funeral, he kills an Arab man in French Algiers, who was involved in a conflict with one of Meursault's neighbors. Meursault is tried and sentenced to death. 
        The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's first-person narrative view before and after the murder, respectively.
        In January 1955, Camus wrote this:
        I summarized <em>The Stranger</em> a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: "In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death." I only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game.[3]
        The Stranger's first edition consisted of only 4,400 copies, which was so few that it could not be a best-seller. 
        Since the novella was published during the Nazi occupation of France, there was a possibility that the Propaganda-Staffel would censor it, but a representative of the Occupation authorities felt it contained nothing damaging to their cause, so it was published without omissions. 
        However, the novel was well received in anti-Nazi circles in addition to Jean-Paul Sartre's article <em>"Explication de L'Étranger"</em>.[4]
        Translated four times into English, and also into numerous other languages, the novel has long been considered a classic of 20th-century literature. Le Monde ranks it as number one on its 100 Books of the Century.
        The novel was twice adapted as films: <em>Lo Straniero</em> (1967) (Italian) by Luchino Visconti and <em>Yazgı</em> (2001, <em>Fate</em>) by Zeki Demirkubuz (Turkish).
