            <strong><em>The Stranger</em></strong> (French: <strong><em>L'Étranger</em></strong> [l‿e.tʁɑ̃.ʒe]), also
            published in English as <strong><em>The Outsider</em></strong>,
            is a 1942 novella by French author Albert Camus. Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus'
            philosophy, absurdism, coupled with existentialism;
            though Camus personally rejected the latter label.[1]
            <br><br>
            The title character is Meursault, an indifferent French settler in Algeria described as "a citizen of France
            domiciled in North Africa, a man of the Mediterranean, an homme du midi yet one who hardly partakes of the
            traditional Mediterranean culture."[2]
            Weeks after his mother's funeral, he kills an Arab man in French Algiers, who was involved in a conflict
            with one of Meursault's neighbors. Meursault is tried and sentenced to death.
            The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's first-person narrative view before and after the
            murder, respectively.
            <br><br>
            In January 1955, Camus wrote this:
            <br><br>
            I summarized <em>The Stranger</em> a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: "In our
            society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death." I only
            meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game.[3]
            <br><br>
            The Stranger's first edition consisted of only 4,400 copies, which was so few that it could not be a
            best-seller.
            Since the novella was published during the Nazi occupation of France, there was a possibility that the
            Propaganda-Staffel would censor it, but a representative of the Occupation authorities felt it contained
            nothing damaging to their cause, so it was published without omissions.
            However, the novel was well received in anti-Nazi circles in addition to Jean-Paul Sartre's article
            <em>"Explication de L'Étranger"</em>.[4]
            <br><br>
            Translated four times into English, and also into numerous other languages, the novel has long been
            considered a classic of 20th-century literature. Le Monde ranks it as number one on its 100 Books of the
            Century.
            <br><br>
            The novel was twice adapted as films: <em>Lo Straniero</em> (1967) (Italian) by Luchino Visconti and
            <em>Yazgı</em> (2001, <em>Fate</em>) by Zeki Demirkubuz (Turkish).

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p1>
            Meursault learns of the death of his mother, who has been living in an old age home in the country. He takes
            time off from work to attend her funeral, but he shows none of the indications of grief or mourning that the
            people around him expect from someone in his situation. When asked if he wishes to view her body, he
            declines, and he smokes and drinks regular (white) coffee - not the obligatory black coffee - at the vigil
            held by his mother's coffin the night before the burial. Most of his comments to the reader at this time are
            about his observations of the aged attendees at the vigil and funeral, which takes place on an unbearably
            hot day.
            <br><br>
            Back in Algiers, Meursault encounters Marie, a former secretary of his firm. The two become re-acquainted,
            swim together, watch a comedy film, and begin to have an intimate relationship. All of this happens on the
            day after his mother's funeral.
