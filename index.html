    <h1><em>The Stranger (Camus novel)</em></h1>

            <strong><em>The Stranger</em></strong> (French: <strong><em>L'Étranger</em></strong> [l‿e.tʁɑ̃.ʒe]), also
            published in English as <strong><em>The Outsider</em></strong>,
            is a 1942 novella by French author Albert Camus. Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus'
            philosophy, absurdism, coupled with existentialism;
            though Camus personally rejected the latter label.[1]
            <br><br>
            The title character is Meursault, an indifferent French settler in Algeria described as "a citizen of France
            domiciled in North Africa, a man of the Mediterranean, an homme du midi yet one who hardly partakes of the
            traditional Mediterranean culture."[2]
            Weeks after his mother's funeral, he kills an Arab man in French Algiers, who was involved in a conflict
            with one of Meursault's neighbors. Meursault is tried and sentenced to death.
            The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's first-person narrative view before and after the
            murder, respectively.
            <br><br>
            In January 1955, Camus wrote this:
            <br><br>
            I summarized <em>The Stranger</em> a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: "In our
            society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death." I only
            meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game.[3]
            <br><br>
            The Stranger's first edition consisted of only 4,400 copies, which was so few that it could not be a
            best-seller.
            Since the novella was published during the Nazi occupation of France, there was a possibility that the
            Propaganda-Staffel would censor it, but a representative of the Occupation authorities felt it contained
            nothing damaging to their cause, so it was published without omissions.
            However, the novel was well received in anti-Nazi circles in addition to Jean-Paul Sartre's article
            <em>"Explication de L'Étranger"</em>.[4]
            <br><br>
            Translated four times into English, and also into numerous other languages, the novel has long been
            considered a classic of 20th-century literature. Le Monde ranks it as number one on its 100 Books of the
            Century.
            <br><br>
            The novel was twice adapted as films: <em>Lo Straniero</em> (1967) (Italian) by Luchino Visconti and
            <em>Yazgı</em> (2001, <em>Fate</em>) by Zeki Demirkubuz (Turkish).

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p1>
            Meursault learns of the death of his mother, who has been living in an old age home in the country. He takes
            time off from work to attend her funeral, but he shows none of the indications of grief or mourning that the
            people around him expect from someone in his situation. When asked if he wishes to view her body, he
            declines, and he smokes and drinks regular (white) coffee - not the obligatory black coffee - at the vigil
            held by his mother's coffin the night before the burial. Most of his comments to the reader at this time are
            about his observations of the aged attendees at the vigil and funeral, which takes place on an unbearably
            hot day.
            <br><br>
            Back in Algiers, Meursault encounters Marie, a former secretary of his firm. The two become re-acquainted,
            swim together, watch a comedy film, and begin to have an intimate relationship. All of this happens on the
            day after his mother's funeral.
            <br><br>
            Over the next few days, Meursault helps Raymond Sintès, a neighbor and friend who is rumored to be a pimp,
            but says he works in a warehouse, to get revenge on a Moorish girlfriend he suspects has been accepting
            gifts and money from another man. Raymond asks Meursault to write a letter inviting the girl over to
            Raymond's apartment solely so that he can have sex with her and then spit in her face and throw her out.
            While he listens to Raymond, Meursault is characteristically unfazed by any feelings of empathy, so he does
            not express concern that Raymond's girlfriend would be emotionally hurt by this plan and agrees to write the
            letter. In general, Meursault considers other people either interesting or annoying, or feels nothing for
            them at all.
            <br><br>
            Raymond's girlfriend visits him on a Sunday morning, and the police get involved when he beats her for
            slapping him after he tries to kick her out. He asks Meursault to testify that the girlfriend had been
            unfaithful when he is called to the police station, to which Meursault agrees. Ultimately, Raymond is let
            off with a warning.
            <br><br>
            While this is going on, Meursault's boss asks him if he would like to work at a branch their firm is
            thinking about opening in Paris and Marie asks him if he wants to get married. In both cases, Meursault says
            that he does not have strong feelings about the matter, but he is willing to move or get married if it will
            please the other party. Also, Salamano, Meursault and Raymond's curmudgeonly old neighbor, loses his abused
            and diseased dog and, though he mostly outwardly maintains his usual spiteful and uncaring attitude toward
            the creature, he goes to Meursault for comfort and advice a few times. During one of these conversations,
            Salamano, who says he adopted the dog as a companion shortly after his wife's death, mentions that some
            neighbors had 'said nasty things' about Meursault after he sent his mother to a retirement home. Meursault
            is surprised to learn about this negative impression of his actions.
            <br><br>
            One weekend, Raymond invites Meursault and Marie to a friend's beach cabin. There they see the brother of
            Raymond's spurned girlfriend along with another Arab, who Raymond has mentioned have been following him
            around recently. The Arabs confront Raymond and his friend, and the brother wounds Raymond with a knife
            before running away. Later, Meursault walks back along the beach alone, armed with a revolver he took from
            Raymond to prevent him from acting rashly, and encounters the brother of Raymond's girlfriend. Disoriented
            and on the edge of heatstroke, Meursault shoots when the Arab flashes his knife at him. It is a fatal shot,
            but Meursault shoots the man four more times after a pause. He does not divulge to the reader any specific
            reason for this act or what he feels, other than being bothered by the heat and intensely bright sunlight.
            <br><br>
        </p1>
        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p1>
            Meursault is now incarcerated. His general detachment and ability to adapt to any external circumstance seem
            to make living in prison tolerable, especially after he gets used to the idea of being restricted and unable
            to have sex with Marie, though he does realize at one point that he has been unknowingly talking to himself
            for a number of days. For almost a year, he sleeps, looks out the small window of his cell, and mentally
            lists the objects in his old apartment while he waits for his day in court.
            <br><br>
            Meursault never denies that he killed the Arab, so, at his trial, the prosecuting attorney focuses more on
            Meursault's inability or unwillingness to cry at his mother's funeral than on the details of the murder. He
            portrays Meursault's quietness and passivity as demonstrating his criminality and lack of remorse and
            denounces Meursault as a soul-less monster who deserves to die for his crime. To the reader, Meursault
            acknowledges that he has never felt regret for any of his actions because, he says, he has always been too
            absorbed in the present moment. Although several of Meursault's friends testify on his behalf and his
            attorney tells him the sentence will likely be light, Meursault is sentenced to be publicly decapitated.
            <br><br>
            Put in a new cell, Meursault obsesses over his impending doom and appeal and tries to imagine some way in
            which he can escape his fate. He repeatedly refuses to see the prison chaplain, but one day the chaplain
            visits him anyway. Meursault says he does not believe in God and is not even interested in the subject, but
            the chaplain persists in trying to lead Meursault away from atheism (or, perhaps more precisely, apatheism).
            The chaplain believes Meursault's appeal will succeed in getting him released from prison, but says such an
            outcome will not get rid of his feelings of guilt or fix his relationship with God. Eventually, Meursault
            accosts the chaplain in a rage. He attacks the chaplain's worldview and patronizing attitude and asserts
            that, in confronting the certainty of the nearness of his death, he has had insights about life and death
            that he feels with a confidence beyond what the chaplain possesses. He says that, although what we say or do
            or feel can cause our deaths to happen at different times or under different circumstances, none of those
            things can change the fact that we are all condemned to die one day, so nothing ultimately matters.
            <br><br>
            After the chaplain leaves, Meursault finds some comfort in thinking about the parallels between his
            situation and how he thinks his mother must have felt when she was surrounded by death and slowly dying at
            the retirement home. Yelling at the chaplain had emptied him of all hope or thoughts of escape or a
            successful appeal, so he is able to open his heart 'to the benign indifference of the universe,' after which
            he decides that he has been, and still is, happy. His final assertion is that a large, hateful crowd at his
            execution will end his loneliness and bring everything to a consummate end.
